    Geographic terms include hierarchies of region, continent, country, and cities. 
    
    * For a U.S. city, the state and country are listed alongside (e.g., 'Los Angeles, California, United States'). 
    * Non-U.S. geographic subdivisions need not include hierarchical relations, with the specific exceptions of Canadian provinces and the countries within the United Kingdom.

    County-level information is typically not indicated. If a U.S. county is included, the state and 'United States' must be included as well.

    The Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names ([http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn/index.html](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn/index.html)) is referenced when adding new geographic names.
