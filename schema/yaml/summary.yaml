  usageNotes: |
    The main goal of the Summary is to give the reader a clear sense of what the data collection is about, including substantive information about the different parts of the data collection not adequately conveyed by the Fileset names or found elsewhere in the metadata. 
    
    A listing of major variables or categories of variables with a few examples is also important, ending with the demographic variables. It is also salient to indicate the unit of analysis for the data collection, i.e., who or what is being studied: individuals, housing units, courts, criminal acts, etc. Most often the unit of analysis is the individual; where it is not, it is particularly important to make this clear.
    
    The Summary is written in the third person and avoids attempting to address issues of how the data might be used, who might be interested in the data, or any evaluative comments about the worth or usefulness of the data collection. The Summary uses past tense when describing the process of collecting the data and present tense when necessary, such as when describing the data (e.g., 'The MIDUS Refresher collection is split into two datasets.'). Numerals are used instead of spelling them out; if a number is spelled out for emphasis, the number is attached in parentheses (e.g. 'Two thousand (2,000)').

    Curators should avoid attempting to address issues of how the data might be used, who might be interested in the data, or any evaluative comments about the worth or usefulness of the study. Statements about conclusions the investigators drew from the data should be omitted. The main goal should be to give the reader a clear sense of what the study is about.  

    Use past tense when describing the process of collecting the data.  Use present tense when necessary, such as when you are describing the data: 'The MIDUS Refresher collection is split into two datasets.'
