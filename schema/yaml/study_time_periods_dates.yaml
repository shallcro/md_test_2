  usageNotes: |
    Study Time Period focuses on the dates the data are actually about, regardless of when the data were collected. 
    
    Study Time Period generally corresponds to the dates that appear in the Study Title; days and months may be included in the Study Time Period even though they are not in the Study Title.

    Dates are formatted in accordance with ISO 8601 (YYYY, YYYY-MM, or YYYY-MM-DD). One hyphen separates the parts of a date; two hyphens separate two dates. Ranges may be expressed in years (YYYY--YYYY), months (YYYY-MM--YYYY-MM), or days (YYYY-MM-DD--YYYY-MM-DD). No spaces are permitted in date expressions.
